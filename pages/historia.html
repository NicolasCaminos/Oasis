                When ‘Some Might Say’ became Oasis’ first Number One
                single in April of 1995, it marked the midpoint of a two year
                period in which they rose from barely known Manchester
                could-bes playing in the tiny back rooms of pubs to the status
                of the most culturally significant rock ‘n’ roll band of the last
                three decades.
                Just 12 months prior, they had released their debut single
                ‘Supersonic’.<img

                By the same time in 1996, they were performing to a quarter
                of a million fans over two nights at UK’s Knebworth Park –
                while ‘(What’s The Story) Morning Glory?’ was well on the
                way to becoming…
                …the fifth biggest selling
                album of all time
                in Britain.

                But more important than tickets or records sold, their biggest songs – the likes of
                ‘Wonderwall’, ‘Don’t Look Back In Anger’ and ‘Champagne Supernova’ –
                are songs that swathes of planet earth knows every last word of.

                Songs that seemed to take on a life of their own the instant that they
                were released, and whose power has not diminished more than a quarter
                of a century later. Songs that will live on long, long after everyone
                involved in their creation has gone.

                Songs that continue to
                inspire generation after
                generation of songwriters to
                pick up an acoustic guitar
                and try and move people in
                the same way.

                Because Oasis encapsulate the glamour, the dream, the
                drama, the attitude and the excitement of what it is to be rock
                ’n’ roll stars better than any of the countless acts that have
                followed in their wake; all of whom – even the ones that were
                not even born when they first arrived – cite them as a direct
                influence.

                Liam Gallagher is a singer
                and a frontman who can
                rival the all time greats…

                    alt=""><br>
                …the last of his kind, with a voice full
                of both attitude and soulfulness, and a
                presence that so many have tried and
                failed to imitate.

                Noel Gallagher is a
                master of melody…

                The cover artwork for 'Heathen Chemistry' showing a blurred, spinning image of the band in a lit tunnel
                …whose catalogue – from ‘Rock ‘n’ Roll Star’, to
                ‘Live Forever’, to ‘Stop Crying Your Heart Out’, to
                ‘The Importance Of Being Idle’ – can go toe to toe with any
                other songwriter in history: a man whose gift for connecting
                with people is a truly special, unique thing.
                <img src="https://oasisinet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Tour-Bus-October-1994-opt.jpg" alt=""><br>
                And that connection, for the eighteen years that Oasis
                existed, is one that reached far beyond the shores of the
                country that the Gallaghers grew up in. From their first
                International tour in Japan in August 1994, to selling out New
                York’s Madison Square Garden in 2005 to River Plate
                Stadium in Buenos Aires in 2009, it was always apparent
                that…
                <img src="https://oasisinet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-shot-2014-02-07-at-12.10.05-499x500-1.png"
                    alt=""><br>
                …the attitude, energy
                and the soulfulness of
                their music was getting
                through to people in a
                way that transcends
                borders and language
                barriers.

                    alt=""><br>
                And so, right up until their split in 2009, it
                continued; in stadiums packed full of devotees
                young and old in South America and North
                America, on mainland Europe, Australia and
                beyond.

                They wanted – most importantly of all – to matter to people
                as much if not more than the bands who had inspired them
                as young, working class dreamers with nothing.
                They wanted to create
                something that would live
                forever, and somehow they
                managed it.
