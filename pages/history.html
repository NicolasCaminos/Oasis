                    <p class="para-history9_1">And so, right up until their split in 2009, it continued; in
                        stadiums packed full of devotees young and old in South
                        America and North America, on mainland Europe, Australia
                        and beyond.

                        In their earliest interviews, Liam and Noel Gallagher were unashamed about
                        their skyscraping ambitions. They wanted to write better songs than anyone
                        else, they wanted to sell more records than anyone else, they wanted to play
                        bigger shows than anyone else.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para-history9_3">They wanted – most importantly of all – to matter to people as much if
                        not
                        more than the bands who had inspired them as young, working class
                        dreamers with nothing.
